### 今天读文献了吗 -- 220816

**1. Elucidating  the influences of embodiment and conceptual metaphor on lexical and non-speech tone learning** 
*(Morett et al., *cognition*, 2022) [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2022.105014 "Persistent link using digital object identifier")*

- how hand gestures enhance language learning and music processing. 

~~

**2. Music-melody perception in tone-language and non-tone-language speakers**

*(Alexander et al., *The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America*, 2008) [link](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/ann-bradlow/publications/2011/Alexander_et_al_2011.pdf)*

- music melody perception

- speech and music
  > - speech and music both utilize pitch variation to convey meaning, emotional affect

- how experience processing lexical pitch (speaking a tonal language) affects music-pitch perception.

- Results: 
  - Mandarin > English speakers in discriminating melodies; (Mann-Whitney U)
  - English > Monadarin in matching melodiers with graphical representations. (Mann-Whitney U)

**3. The influence of linguistic experience on the cognitive processing of pitch in speech and nonspeech sounds**

(Bent et al., *J. Exp. Psychol.: Hum. Percept. Perform.*, 2006) [link](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/ann-bradlow/publications/2006/BentBradlowWright2006.pdf)

- cognitive processing of pitch in nonspeech sounds
  > 1. Mandarin listeners were more accurate at identifying Mandarin tones than English listeners.
  > 2. No significant listener group differences were observed on the nonspeech pitch discrimination threshold
  > 3. Mandarin listeners were less accurate than English listeners in the nonspeech pitch contour test
