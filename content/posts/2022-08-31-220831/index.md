#### Music and Language: A Developmental Comparison

> Learning Music and Language

- the sound structure of language and music
  - leaning about linguistic and musical systems during development
  - overlap? 
    - both are generated from a finite set of sounds (notes, phonemes), are organized into discrete categories.
    - facilitating representation and memory
    - involves categorical perception -- discrimination can be difficult within one category
  - **6-month infants have been attuned to the vowels in their own native language  compared with the other non-native languages**, which suggested a implicitly learning leading to the nonnative-to-native shift. 
  - Western participants showed better detection for changes in **melodies that conform to western tonal conventions**.
- How do we learn it -- memory for language and music
  - researches mainly on long-term memory
- Learning mechanisms for language and music 
  - derive structures represented in memory
  - mechanism 1: rules (top-down predict)
  - mechanism 2: statistics (statistical learning)
    - statistical learning for musical tone sequences
    - for tonal language speakers (**can be mentioned in discussion**)
