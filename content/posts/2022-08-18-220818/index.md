#### 1. Tone language experience enhances sensitivity to melodic contour

(Bradley, 2012, *LSA Annual Meeting Extended Abstracts*) [link](https://doi.org/10.3765/exabs.v0i0.612)

- lexical tone -- also a primary component of music
- acoustic dimensions of lexical tones *v.s.* musical melodies: 
  - height  -- key
  - direction -- contour
  - slope -- interval (the size of change between notes)

- Hypothesis of two perspective:
  - Shared Sound Category Learning Mechanism Hypothesis (Patel, 2008)
  - Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT) -- learning begins at the highest neural level (Ahissar et al., 2009)  
    - hypothesis for the study: the *key* condition does not differ.
- cited important papers: Stevens et al., 2004 (language tonality -> perception of musical contour)
