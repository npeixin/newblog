### 今天读文献了吗 -- 220912


#### 1. Neural overlap in processing music and speech
(Peretz et al., 2015)

- neural overlap : coactivation of brain regions 
- overlap 等于sharing 吗？不一定哦
- evidence from neuroimaging studies : neural overlap **in the responses to vocal and musical stimuli**. --> neural sharing between music and speech processing. 
  - superior temporal sulcus(颞上沟) -- voice processing -- stronger response to vocalization with or without linguistic content than to non-vocal sounds.
  - tonal encoding of pitch -- inferior frontal areas (额下区域) -- network: right auditory cortex - inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, 额下回) （布洛卡区-- 大部分在左侧IFG， 运动语言中枢）
- Broca's area (left IFG), focus of interest in music and language comparisons, and other brain structures are relatively large and complex.  -- easy to accommodate more than one distinct processing network. -- not dictated by sharing.
- network 'hubs' shared by music and speech processing?
- Overlap in STG
  - anterior STG(前颞上回) responds more strongly to music than to human voice. but also have significant activation to speech.
  - left posterior temporal lobe (language selective regions), also show significant response to music. 
  - 颞叶大片区域对音乐和声音both responded more.



#### 2. Neural mechanisms of music and language
(Ogg & Slev, 2019)

- neural structures to facilitate these abilities?
- overlap between music and langauge:
  - strongest overlap --> in the brainstem
  - followed by --> auditory cortex
